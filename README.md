## Concepts Used 💡
- **API Calls**: Utilized `fetch` to get weather data from an external API.
- **State Management**: Managed search input, weather data, and loading states using `useState`.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displayed loading indicators and error messages based on API response.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the UI adapts to different screen sizes.
